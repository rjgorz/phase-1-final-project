WHATS COOKIN? is a simple and strait forward application that gives the user menu choices, covering main dishes, side dishes and desserts.

There are two containers to guide the user in their choices.

The Left container consists of three buttons.

The Right container will show a typeable input field when select by main ingredient is selected, or a dropdown of choices when search by category is selected.

The first button in the left container "Search By Main Ingredient" allows the user to input the main ingredient that they have on hand, or are looking for a new idea to use the ingredient with. It then opens a text box, in the Right container, where the ingredient is then input and upon clicking 'submit' returns a list of meals that contain that ingredient to choose from are displayed.

The second button in the left container "Search By Category" opens a dropdown, in the Right container, that allows the user to select from a pregenerated list of categories, including but not limited to: beef, chicken, lamb, and dessert. Upon clicking on the category item a list of choices are displayed on the screen to choose from.

The third button in the left container "Random Food" fetches a random menu suggestion and displays the result on the screen.

The "Reset Forms" button on the Right container, in the lower right corner, allows the user to reset the selected option back to the start, allowing the user to make different choices.

Once a choice has been made, all the menu items are displayed under the containers with pictures of the finished meal. The user can hover over the picture and the name of the item will be displayed. When the user clicks on the picture it will open the recipe card over the screen displaying the grocery list and the steps to be performed for completion of the meal.
